<h1>US Healthcare Analysis</h1>
This project analyzes a dataset from the US healthcare department that contains hospital records from 100 hospitals. <br>The dataset includes three main categories of information:
                    <br>1.<strong> Demographic Information –</strong> Name, Age, gender, and Blood group.
                    <br>2. <strong>Patient Information –</strong>  Medical conditions, Date of admission/discharge, admission type.
                    <br>3. <strong>Insurance Information –</strong>  Coverage details related to patients.
                    <br><br>The goal of this project is to study patient demographics, medical conditions, and hospital utilization trends to help hospitals optimize their resources, improve patient care, and identify risk groups for specific diseases.

                            ✅ Understood and collect the dataset from relevant source.
                        <br>✅ Created a copy of raw data for analysis and protected the raw data.
                        <br>✅ Created notes (explanation the data and steps taken).
                        <br>✅ Cleaned the data by handling missing values and uniform formating.
                        <br>✅ Performed sample size analysis.
                        <br>✅ EDA (Performed Feature Engineering).
                        <br>✅ Designed & developed the dashboard in Excel.
                    <br><br><strong><h3>🐱 Key Analysis Performed :</h3></strong><hr><ol>
                    <li><strong> Gender-wise Medical Condition –</strong> Compared prevalence of diseases among male and female patients.
                    <li><strong>Age-wise Medical Condition –</strong> Studied how diseases differ across seniors, middle-aged, and young groups.
                    <li><strong>Demographic Analysis (Age + Gender) –</strong> Combined age and gender to identify high-risk groups for each disease.
                    <li><strong>Medical Condition Trend Analysis by Age Groups –</strong> Tracked disease patterns across seniors, middle-aged, and young patients.
                    <li><strong>Best Insurance provider –</strong> Analyzed insurance company preference across different age groups (Young, Middle-aged, Senior) to identify the dominant provider for each segment.
                    <li><strong>Day-wise Patient Footfall Analysis –</strong> Monitored patient admissions across days of the month to spot utilization trends.
                    <li><strong>Normalization Analysis –</strong> Compared patient distribution before and after normalization to optimize hospital resources.</ol>
                    <br><strong><h3>🐱 Insights :</h3></strong><hr><ol>
                    <li><strong> Most common diseases –</strong> Hypertension, arthritis, and cancer dominate across hospitals. 
                        <li><strong> Gender-based trends –</strong> Females are more prone to arthritis, obesity, and diabetes, while males  show higher hypertension cases.
                        <li><strong>Age-based patterns –</strong> Seniors mostly suffer from arthritis, middle-aged patients face lifestyle  diseases (diabetes, hypertension, obesity), and asthma is most common among young patients.
                        <li><strong> Demographic risk groups</strong>:<ul>
                            <li> Arthritis: Senior & middle-aged females
                            <li> Asthma: Young males & females
                            <li> Cancer: Middle-aged females & senior males
                            <li> Diabetes: More common in females
                            <li> Hypertension: Middle-aged & senior males
                            <li> Obesity: Middle-aged & senior females</ul>
                    <li><strong>Insurance Analysis –</strong> Blue Cross covers both young and senior patients, while Medicare is dominant & best suited for  middle-aged patients. Insurance preference varies with age, highlighting how providers target specific demographic  groups.
                    <li><strong>Footfall pattern –</strong> First week has low patient visits, while the second week shows a sharp rise,  causing uneven hospital workload.
                    <li><strong>Normalization benefit –</strong> Balances patient flow (200–400 per day) instead of sharp fluctuations  (150–600), helping hospitals use resources more efficiently.</ol>
                    <br><strong><h3>🐱 Impact :</h3></strong><hr><ul>
                    <li> Hospitals can use these insights to plan staff schedules, allocate resources, and develop  age/gender-specific healthcare programs.
                    <li> Insurance providers can use the data to design better policies for high-risk groups which can increases their profit by 10% to 15%.
                    <li> Customers can wisly choose their insurence providers.</ul>
